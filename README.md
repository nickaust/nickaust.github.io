# Nick Austin's CIT 281 Projects and Labs

## Overview
The following are the completed labs and projects with descriptions and links to find the code. 

## Projects
- **Project 1:** This project introduces students to using the command line and Visual Studio Code for basic file management and JavaScript programming. Students will create a specific folder structure, practice using network commands like ping, and write two JavaScript programs: one that displays the current day of the week, and another that generates a random string of lowercase letters. The project builds practical skills in both operating system navigation and foundational coding. [View Here](https://github.com/nickaust/p1.git)

- **Project 2:** This project teaches students how to use git from the command line and Visual Studio Code to manage code changes and version control. Students will refactor a JavaScript program that generates random lowercase letters, organizing the code into functions and improving readability. They will also practice using git commands, create a .gitignore file, and rewrite functions as function expressions. The project builds skills in both JavaScript refactoring and essential git workflows. [View Here](https://github.com/nickaust/p2.git)

- **Project 3:** This project guides students through building the "Ultimate Coin Tool," a web application that calculates all possible US coin combinations for a given amount and determines the value of various coin counts. Students will develop modular JavaScript code, create and test functions for coin calculations, and build a Node.js Express server with REST API routes. The project also includes creating a web interface for user interaction, practicing JSON handling, using git for version control, and managing project files with a .gitignore.

- **Project 4:** This project guides students through building a question-and-answer REST API web server using Node.js and Express. Students will organize data and code into modules, implement functions to retrieve and manage questions and answers, and set up API routes to handle client requests. The project covers creating and exporting JavaScript modules, testing functions, and responding to various GET requests with JSON. Optional extra credit includes adding POST, PUT, and DELETE support for creating, updating, and deleting questions and answers, further developing full CRUD API skills.

- **Project 5:** This project challenges students to build a full-stack browser game using Node.js, Express, and modern JavaScript features. Students will create classes with properties/methods, implement game logic using arrays and functional methods (map/forEach), develop a REST API server with GET/POST routes, and design a client interface with API interactions. The project integrates object-oriented programming, server-client communication, and DOM manipulation while requiring documentation of game states. [View Here](https://github.com/nickaust/p5.git)
